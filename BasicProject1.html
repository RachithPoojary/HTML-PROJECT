                üöÄ Hi! I'm a Computer Science undergrad at Mumbai University
                with a standout CGPA of 9.30. My academic journey has been
                enriched by a deep understanding of computing principles, thanks
                to my formative years at Jnanasudha PU college and VPM's
                Semi-English School. üèÖ Experience has been my best teacher.
                I've had the honor of serving as the "president" of my college
                and as a class representative, roles that polished my leadership
                and teamwork skills. Teaching students as a home tutor has also
                refined my communication and active listening abilities.
